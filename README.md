# 🐼 Pandas Tips & Tricks

This repository contains a curated list of useful **Pandas tips and tricks** that I practiced during my data analysis learning journey.

These tips help with:
- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Grouping & filtering
- Missing value handling
- Reshaping and feature engineering

| No. | Topic                              | Description                            |
|-----|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1   | Checking Missing Values            | Use `.isnull()`, `.sum()`              |
| 2   | Grouping and Aggregation           | Use `.groupby()` with multiple columns |
| 3   | Unstacking                         | Use `.unstack()` to reshape data       |
| 4   | Encoding Categorical Variables     | `.map()`, `.astype()` safely           |
| 5   | Continuous to Categorical          | `pd.cut()` for age groups              |
| 6   | Reshaping Data                     | Use `.melt()` for long format          |
| 7   | Filling Missing Values             | `.fillna()` with mean or fixed value   |
| 8   | Dropping Rows/Columns              | Use `.drop()` with `axis`              |
| 9   | String Operations                  | `.str.lower()`, `.str.contains()` etc. |
| 10  | DateTime Handling                  | `pd.to_datetime()`, `.dt` attributes   |
